My projects aiming to streamline common React dev tasks:

- [Routescape](https://routescape.js.org)
- [Groundstate](https://github.com/axtk/groundstate)
- [Transient State](https://github.com/axtk/transient-state)

My stories about them:

- [A React router to my liking](https://axtk.github.io/x/routescape)
- [Conjuring the minimal shared state setup in React](https://axtk.github.io/x/groundstate)
- [Unobtrusive async action state tracking in React](https://axtk.github.io/x/transient_state)
