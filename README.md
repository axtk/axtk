My projects aiming to streamline common React dev tasks:

- [routescape.js.org](https://routescape.js.org)
- [groundstate.js.org](https://groundstate.js.org)

My stories about them:

- [Conjuring the minimal shared state setup in React](https://axtk.github.io/x/groundstate)
- [Unobtrusive async action state tracking in React](https://axtk.github.io/x/transient_state)
